# MicrosoftApi
OOP II project with Microsoft Cognitive Services APIs

Here will be our team project in which we use two of Microsoft Cognitive Services API: Computer vision and Bing image search.

The main idea of our app is to give user a possibility to upload their own picture, use url of an image or take image with webcam, analyse it with the API and based on the results look for similar images. The user will have possibility to fine tune the search parameters to include additional keywords or delete unnecessary ones. The idea is also to give user option to search for image of a certain size or particular license (for example for commercial use or for general purposes without modification).

- Computer vision API analyses image and returns tags and caption
- Bing Image Search searches for an image similar to the initial one based on tags and description and additional
parameters included by the user.
